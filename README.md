# Combinatoral Algorithms

Programs I wrote while reading Knuth's *Art of Computer Programming Volume 4A*. 

> *Low-level details of machine language programming have been covered extensively in those volumes, so the algorithms in the present book are usually specified only at an abstract level, independent of any machine.* - Donald Knuth

Volume 4A has a few sections in MMIX, but a the majority of it is independent of any machine or specific programming language. I decided to follow along with this book in Julia partly to learn the language and partly because the REPL allows me to play around with ideas quickly.
